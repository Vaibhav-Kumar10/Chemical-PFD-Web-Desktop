"""
Smart Auto-Routing Algorithm for Chemical PFD Editor
Implements orthogonal routing with obstacle avoidance using BFS pathfinding.

Features:
- Grid-based logical coordinate system with configurable resolution
- Obstacle detection for component bounding rectangles
- Existing connection path blocking
- BFS-based shortest orthogonal path computation
- Dynamic re-routing when components move
- Clean orthogonal path generation (H/V segments only)
